Lit in a blue light from torches made of the flammable but incredibly long-burning Caoxite gemstone, the understreets is a traders haven, an almost completely free marketplace where anything from food to firearms change hands every day. The understreets run below the cities sewer system, creating a buffer layer in-between the front face of the Reach and the hushed underground civilisation.</p><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" style="" class=" csg-commonTable"><tr><td style="" class="ak-editor-panel"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" style="" class=" csg-commonTable"><tr><td style="" class="csg-panel-inner"><p class="csg-p"><span class="csg-mark-strong"><span class="csg-mark-em">Note: </span></span><span class="csg-mark-em">Caoxite is a matte, dark blue gem found within the mines of both the understreets and of </span><a href="ckyhsndfx001602wc7p98pho1.html">Tarren's Reach</a><span class="csg-mark-em">.

This was later discovered by a group of wrongfully accused adventurers who were thrown in the sewer system by the military, and as such, the understreets were born.</p><p class="csg-p">The understreets operates in stark contrast to the city above, with a semi-direct democratic governing system. Each outpost has all of its citizens propose ideas and make decisions for its outpost and how it operates, with unanimous decision required in order to pass any legislation. Thanks to each outposts small scale, this works surprisingly effectively, and also creates many fascinatingly different societies in one space.</p><p class="csg-p">Each outpost also has an elected spokesperson who represents the outpost in the understreets Collective, where decisions that effect every outpost are made - such as economics, warfare and street etiquette. The collective only requires a 3/4 majority to pass legislation, not only because outposts come and go frequently, but because two major outposts, the Blaucutters and the Worf Collective are locked in a seemingly never-ending gang war, and almost always disagree at Collective meetings. Passing the legislation to switch from unanimous to 3/4 voting was one of very few laws they agreed on, and the total laws they agreed on number in the single digits.</p><p class="csg-p">When it comes to the economy, the understreets returns to a standard economic system of buying and selling. There are usually no costs to live somewhere in the understreets, just find an outpost who will take you in and settle down in an alcove. Each month, a small tax is collected by the Collective which is then given to trader scouts, sent into the wider world to spend the collected money on items from a 'shopping list' created by the Collective members consisting of materials and plans for what needs done in the understreets. As <a href="ckyhsndfx001602wc7p98pho1.html">Tarren's Reach</a> was founded upon the basis of a dead, lost civilisation, Electrum pieces are abundant and are used almost as frequently as gold and silver. Platinum is still rare however not as uncommon as it would be in other places - the understreets are filled with a vast variety of traders, after all.</p><p class="csg-p">In terms of violence, the majority of the understreets lives in peace, however outpost warfare takes place in back alleys, forgotten rooms and unlit crevasses, away from public eye. This is actually law in the understreets - violence and warfare must be declared at the Collective as ongoing between the involved parties and is only allowed amongst parties who have agreed to fight. These fights must never in the public eye, in order to keep the tight main spaces clean and the civilians unharmed. Those willing to fight simply bear the soldier insignia of their outpost or outpost alliance, indicating they are willing to do battle. Opposing fighters who meet each other in public must discuss and agree to fight, and must take it to a private area.</p><p class="csg-p">This legislation has proven wildly successful and results in very few civilian murders and very low damages to businesses. It also promotes a much more "gentlemanly" method of warfare, where if someone does not wish to fight at a certain time, they may deny combat and suffer damage only to their personal morale.</p><p class="csg-p">Discovery or knowledge of the understreets is strictly forbidden by the Great Leader, and as such the longest lasting propaganda campaign of <a href="ckyhsndfx001602wc7p98pho1.html">Tarren's Reach</a> is the "Understreets Misinformation" campaign. The population have been brainwashed to believe that the understreets are a myth made by rival nations out of jealousy of the great divine blessings bestowed upon <a href="ckyhsndfx001602wc7p98pho1.html">Tarren's Reach</a>, and anyone attempting to convince someone that the understreets exists is to be reported to a local street officer at once. Of course, anyone who discovers or starts to believe in the understreets is hunted down and sent to the DRC in order to be educated.</p>    </div>    </div>
