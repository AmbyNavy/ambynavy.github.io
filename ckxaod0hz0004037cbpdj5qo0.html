They see each other as necessary to keeping the actual cosmic truths, the Almighty, from ever coming into the material plane. Very few Almighty share the view of the gods in wanting to preserve the world, and therefore those who do are at a constant war with those who donâ€™t - a battle out with human comprehension and only somewhat within that of the gods.</p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">This does not mean there have never been arguments between those gods or wars between their followers on the material plane, in fact far from it. Currently, the <a href="ckx8933fv000202wcs8zk66e8.html">Sisters of Cycle</a> are in a lengthy argument over the prosperity of Cimmeris and its people - <a href="ckx893iv3000402wclag09gj4.html">Nina</a> argues the people require advancement in the state of the world as more people pass on due to incapability of comprehending the unknown becoming known, while <a href="ckx893rl4000602wcjutgq74f.html">Pasch</a> disagrees, believing the rise in insanity will soon fade naturally as the people come to terms with what they discover. </p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Despite this being just a standoffish disagreement between the Sisters which runs little to no risk of getting worse, it has sparked a quickly escalating cold war amongst their followings on Cimmeris after the most spiritual of each side the felt the Sisters anger towards each other grow. The battle council watches this cold war with bated breath, both excited and concerned to see what the people of Cimmeris do.</p></li></ul></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Many evil gods are simply classified as evil by mortal standards because of their beliefs and purposes, however such morality is a lot more vague amongst the gods.</p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p"><a href="ckx893rl4000602wcjutgq74f.html">Pasch</a> and <a href="ckx893iv3000402wclag09gj4.html">Nina</a> (when not arguing) actually love each other as sisters despite mortal classifications, and are known to spend almost all of their time together. </p></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Similarly, <a href="ckx895ugb000q02wcdw6xkcff.html">Renak</a>, <a href="ckx895ize000o02wcua8p4c99.html">Bouvorena</a>, <a href="ckx8964ko000s02wc3zsw0cub.html">Damari</a> and <a href="ckx896c1k000u02wclhuwd346.html">Gascu</a> are a tight friend group who trust each other immensely, making for a great reason as to why they form the command of the battle council.</p></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p"><a href="ckx89428x000802wcbatkrql2.html">Or</a> spends a lot of his time with their parent <a href="ckx89458v000a02wcyxwgzdwn.html">Em</a>, a bond which many of the other gods rely on for comprehension of the Almighty, forming a keystone of the wall of divine beings standing between the  material and the unfathomable.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p class="csg-p"/>    </div>    </div>
