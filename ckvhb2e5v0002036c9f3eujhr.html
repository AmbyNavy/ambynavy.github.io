They didn't <span class="csg-mark-em">expand </span>much on the mainland, focusing more on perfection than expansion. Drow did sprawl further, where they ended up meeting the cave dwarves, and wood elves are known to travel the world far more, with outposts being dotted through forests, swamps and jungles reaching far further than the Drow civilisation, however therefore are much more divided and have only their coastal town and island as one colloquial home for the elves. </p></li></ul></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">State of Magic</p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Magic is prominent and powerful. </p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Magical beings exist everywhere, with many exhibiting so many inhuman traits and divine powers. Magic users aren’t few and far between, anything but - in fact, in recent years many children and teenagers have been raised with at least the basics of magic knowledge. </p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">This comes with a somewhat darker reason - magic is used by many for malicious purposes due to its strength, and almost all powerful casters have some kind of weapon and magic shielding spells in their arsenal - whether it be a forcefield, the ability to stop and even redirect projectiles, or just straight up restraining people close enough to take a sword swing at them.</p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">That doesn't mean that melee and ranged combat is useless in such a world, far from it. Many of these spells come with taxing usage costs on the caster or have magic counters to nullify them - the most popular defensive skill, Shield of Vision, only blocks attacks that the caster can see. This ends up creating openings for traditional weapon wielders to wreak havoc on casters, especially pure-magic casters with much of their defence being stripped so quickly.  Magic is still essential for every arsenal however, as spells and cantrips carry such great utility and survivability for those alone, and spectacular tag-teaming opportunities for those in a party.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Divinities and Patrons</p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Onyx (they/them).

These fulgent beams are known to cause permanent damage to the eyes of those who merely glance at them without any form of eye protection, and the heat from one can burn the skin if caught in its spotlight (there are even a slim few recorded cases of people being burned to death). </p></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Observatories have been established in order to attempt predictions for the next Nightstar Blinding and their intensity, with many also reaching towards a deeper understanding of the cosmos and its likely inhabitants. </p></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">When observed from afar or with appropriate ocular equipment and solid cover above one’s head, the Blindings are actually oddly beautiful. As their grand rays collide with the earth, those who watch through specific lenses can observe the whole spectrum of colour, resulting in some younger children take to nicknaming it a Rainbow Shower, and some more religious folk declaring them as the tears of the gods.</p></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Wars and Alliances</p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Secret Conflicts/Alliances?</p><ul class="csg-ul"><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">I'm thinking the Drow actually don't like the other elven races and are secretly plotting an uprising against them with a cave dwarf alliance, and players can catch onto it by overhearing meetings and elven players catching bad glances from Drow and cave dwarves</p></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">Factions and Guilds</p></li><li class="csg-li"><p class="csg-p">New Horrific Monsters (hehe i am very mean)</p></li></ul><p class="csg-p"/>    </div>    </div><div id='ckxpamygj0010037c3jp63mld' class='tabcontent'>    <div class='lk-tab' id='ckxpamygj0010037c3jp63mld'>      <img style="width: 58.59375%;max-width: 100%;" class="csg-media-single-center"><div/></img><img style="width: 58.59375%;max-width: 100%;" class="csg-media-single-center"><div/></img><p class="csg-p"/>    </div>    </div>
