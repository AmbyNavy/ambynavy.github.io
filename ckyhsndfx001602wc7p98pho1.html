A theocratic, monarchic dictatorship, the Reach is governed by a sole, female Great Leader, currently Venicia Tarren II. Men are not allowed to be the Great Leader of Tarren, however do still fill many governmental and advisory roles.</p><p class="csg-p">The decisions made by the Great Leader are considered divine messages and the whole people of Tarren's Reach are under a forced command to work as a whole community in order to please the gods and, therefore, are brainwashed from birth to believe fully in the decisions of the Great Leader so that the gods may bless Tarren's Reach furthermore. Worship of any god other than <a href="ckx895ugb000q02wcdw6xkcff.html">Renak</a> is forbidden and anyone caught worshipping another are sent to a place called the "Divine Rehabilitation Compound".</p><p class="csg-p">Tarren's Reach is a mostly money-less society. Operating off of a barter system as well as traded labour, anyone who chooses to reside permanently in Tarren's Reach must surrender all forms of currency to the royal family, in order for it to be "repurposed for community growth". Businesses who collect money from outsiders are required to surrender all currency at the end of the month, and in return receive state-owned "businessman" housing of different tiers, depending on how much is given. Quite often, businesses completely refuse currency, instead demanding bartering items or labour for resources.</p><p class="csg-p">In order to help the transition from money to barter, the largest businesses of the Reach are marked with a Tarren Blazon, a sign which shows this store is royally recognised as a place to barter easily, and also one who takes currency for barter materials. Many visitors and also many citizens struggle to understand how to survive the system that is in place, resulting in the lower class being the overwhelming majority population, with lifespan being short, poverty being rife and few new businesses ever starting.</p><p class="csg-p">As business startup is limited mostly to a few select taverns, smiths, alchemists and specialised "adventure shops", almost all of the populace instead end up opting for "divine jobs" - state-employment required by the Great Leader in order to expand their plans of almighty worship. Divine jobs consist of standard things like mining and forestry as well as more special tasks like construction of divine altars or tapestry sewing and amulet forging.</p><p class="csg-p">Workers are fed basic food by the heavily religious military officers of each job, and live what most would consider relatively miserable lives, however all city military divisions are trained to have a mysterious spell that allows them to greatly lift the mood of citizens and delay most exhaustion and detrimental effects for up to 24 hours, after which the spell needs to be applied again. eventually those under the influence of this spell do need to rest and recover, at which point they are taken to a "Divine Rehabilitation Compound" (DRC) to recover and then return to work again after.</p>    </div>    </div>
