Long, blonde, wavy hair with subdued blue skin and amber orange eyes. above average height at ~ 5'11", slim but not thin with a well-trained physique, a medium sized chest and slightly muscular - certainly more trained for dexterity than pure brawn, however. her arms and upper torso (top of bust to almost all the neck) have slowly moving constellations below the skin, dimly glowing a lighter blue. Known to change hairstyles and colours often but most common is left completely free and as her natural blonde. Other most common hair colour is a darker brown colour and with it tied in a single large flat braid over her right shoulder.</p><p class="csg-p">Pointed chin but not sharp, more rounded. slim nose with a rosy rounded tip and very slightly larger corneas than normal. Rounded but not bloated jawline and small freckles like stars on her cheeks and over her nose.  </p><h2 class="csg-h2">Clothing </h2><p class="csg-p">Most days, Ennia wears a tan-coloured cropped top with a belt-holster underneath her chest, just above her stomach that holds a small, light hammer under her left arm. For her lower half, she wears flexible but skin-tight dark grey leggings which end halfway down her calves, and a navy waistcloth with white trim and a few gold inlays around her hips. She wears thick foot wraps on her feet. </p><p class="csg-p">While working at the observatory, attending formal occasions or just whenever she feels like it, Ennia chooses to wear the garment of her associates. The robe is primarily white (not bright however) and covers the whole body. The sleeves go to just past her shoulders and two large navy stripes cross the chest and down either side of the leg parts, with a central white cloth with navy trim dangling between the legs. On each shoulder and in the centre of the waist as a belt buckle are golden circles with glowing constellations inset. there are also two rounded off rectangles of similar design on the navy strips around her chest. beneath the robe she wears her same tan top and grey leggings, but on her feet she wears navy slip-ons with a slightly raised heel, trying its best to strike a balance between style and combat practicality. she also wears neater but thinner white foot wraps while wearing these. Ennia also always wears a choker-style necklace that looks like the constellation details on her robes.</p><p class="csg-p"/>    </div>    </div><div id='ckyfz2jf0000702wc3vozj9iu' class='tabcontent'>    <div class='lk-tab' id='ckyfz2jf0000702wc3vozj9iu'>      <p class="csg-p">Ennia Salveri was born to an eladrin elf woman named Eyven and high elf man named Tarvani in the elven mainland capital of Veynell. Born under a rare, purple, double full astros, Ennia is one of a rare few people that are considered to be blessed by the Goddess of space and time, meaning the Eriditum Observatory in Veynell were quick to take her in as a student as soon as she could walk and talk, almost sealing her future into the cosmological studies. Her parents did not object, as her being taken in allowed them to climb the social ladder rapidly, becoming a greatly wealthy family within the city walls. Her father went on to become the district mayor for the Dusk Band, while her mother got in close with the political sphere, eventually landing herself as the commander of the Veynell Limporna, the city guard/army.</p><p class="csg-p">While her parents rose in power and fame, Ennia studied away with the many masterminds and scholars of the Eriditum Observatory. As the Eriditum headmasters prophesied, Ennia was a star student and an even better researcher, frequently slaving away at books and gazing upon both the stars in the sky and the creatures that were captured and kept in her place of study - the Observatory considered everything when looking for answers, after all. Ennia was not a particularly popular child however, having a select few friends but often keeping herself to herself - she was much too busy studying to develop her social skills, conversing better in more serious, studious conversations than casual chit chat. She was never bullied however, as her dreadfully polite manner made her just too kind to be picked on (as well as her parents being some of the most powerful in the land).</p><p class="csg-p">One day after her lessons (which she was starting to assist in teaching) she stumbled across a training session for the Eriditum Keystones, the guards of the Observatory. After some incredibly polite discussion as always, she asked if she could join them in training, passing it off as simply being interested, hiding her ulterior motive of wanting to explore the world in order to find answers. Proving to be a natural at hand-to-hand combat mostly, she started to train in her room at night and would visit training frequently.</p><p class="csg-p">After a while, her master, Danera, presented her with a long, ornate but dusty case. He explained; "within this box lies what remains of Starsplitter, the sword of the great Scarlet - once simply a studious elf, now the God of space and skies we all worship here. Few students who have passed through here have been deemed worthy enough by the powerful arcane energy that seals this here case to even open it, and none have been able to lift what is inside. I do however believe that your eladrin-high heritage - just like Scarlet's - and birth under the purple astros may well make you the one who finally brandishes this divine blade." Sure enough, Ennia succeeded in opening the case and managed to - nigh effortlessly - lift the greatsword from its velvet cushioning, however could instantly tell this wondrous blade did not embody the same strength it once did.</p><p class="csg-p">Now embodied with a second purpose, Ennia began training with Starsplitter heavily. The blade was incredibly light in her hands, allowing it to be wielded quite dexterously, however in the hands of others it was like swinging a whole tree. Eventually, Ennia was awarded the title of Eriditum Stalwart, and was granted permission to leave for periods of time on order to attune Starsplitter to her and awake it's latent strength, as well as to discover new theories about the universe and how it links to the creatures of Cimmeris.</p>    </div>    </div>
